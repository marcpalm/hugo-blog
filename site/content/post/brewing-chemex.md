## Book recommendation

This is essentially a summary of the book **Warren Buffett and the interpretation of financial statements** by Mary Buffett and David Clark. Mary Buffett was maried to the son of Warren and got first hand education in the valuation of stocks by the Oracle of Omaha.

## What is a balance sheet?

The balance sheet reflects the state of a company at a given point in time. There is usually one for every quarter. It has three sections

### Assets
what the company owns in cash, investments, machinery, real estate and open bills to be collectable
### Liabilities
What the company owe in open bills, income tax, short and long-term liabilities
### Shareholder Equity
What the company issued in preferred & common stock, retained earnings and stock repurchases

Relation between assets, liabilities, share holder equity is that assets should equal the sum of liabilities and share holder equity.

```
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholder Equity
```
