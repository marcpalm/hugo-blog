## Book recommendation

This is essentially a summary of the book **Warren Buffett and the interpretation of financial statements** by Mary Buffett and David Clark. Mary Buffett was maried to the son of Warren and got first hand education in the valuation of stocks by the Oracle of Omaha.

## What is a balance sheet?

The balance sheet reflects the state of a company at a given point in time. There is usually one for every quarter. It has three sections

### Assets
what the company owns in cash, investments, machinery, real estate and open bills to be collectable
### Liabilities
What the company owe in open bills, income tax, short and long-term liabilities
### Shareholder Equity
What the company issued in preferred & common stock, retained earnings and stock repurchases

Relation between assets, liabilities, share holder equity is that assets should equal the sum of liabilities and share holder equity.

```
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholder Equity
```

## Where to find the balance sheet?

* yahoo finance
* Each company has a section on their website for investors

## What are the assets of a company?

* Cash & Cash Equivalents: cash and short term bonds (< 3 months)
* Total Inventory: pile of inventory
* Total Receivable, Net: uncollected bills
* Prepaid Expenses: prepayments for services and inventory
* Property, Plant, Equipment: value minus depreciation
* Goodwill, Net: difference between acquisition and book value
* Intangibles, Net: patents, copy rights, brand names, etc.
* Long-Term Investments: investments in stocks, bonds, real estate and other companies
* Other Long-Term Assets: remaining assets receivable > 1 year

## Current Assets vs Total Assets

* Total Current Assets: this is the sum of the cash and equivalents, inventory, receivable and prepaid expenses.

```
    Cash & Cash Equivalents
+   Total Inventory
+   Total Receivable, Net
+   Prepaid Expenses
______________________
=   Total Current Assets

```

* Total Assets: this is the sum of all assets.


```
    Total Current Assets
+   Property, Plant, Equipment
+   Goodwill, Net
+   Intangibles, Net
+   Long-Term Investments
+   Other Long-Term Assets
______________________
=   Total Assets

```

## What are the liabilities of a company?

* Accounts Payable: money owed to suppliers
* Accrued Expenses: expenses not yet invoiced
* Short-Term Debt: debt payable within one year
* Long-Term Debt Due: other debt coming due in the current year
* Other Current Liabilities: other payables within one year
* Long-Term Debt: debt not payable with the current year
* Deferred Income Tax: income taxes owed 
* Minority Interest: the portion of companies owned by 80%, but not 100% can turn up here
* Other Liabilities: catchall category for debt none of the above, e.g. fines, taxes.

## Current Liabilities vs Total Liabilities

* Total Current Liabilities is the sum of all liabilities payable within the current year:

```
    Accounts Payable
+   Accrued Expenses
+   Short-Term Debt
+   Other Current Liabilities
______________________
=   Total Current Liabilities

```

* Total Liabilities is the sum of all liabilities

```
    Total Current Liabilities
+   Long-Term Debt
+   Deferred Income Tax
+   Minority Interest
+   Other Liabilities
______________________
=   Total Assets

```

## What is Book Value?

Book value reflects the total value of a company's assets that shareholders of that company would receive if the company were to be liquidated.

```
    Total Assets
-   Intangibles, Net
-   Total Liabilities
_____________________
=   Book value

```

## What is the enterprise value?

Enterprise value defines the price you would have to pay to acquire the company now:

Market capitalisation + Liabilities - Cash


Of course, this is a highly theoretical measure because in practice once you start bidding, the market capitalisation starts to rise.

## What is Share Holder Equity?

* Preferred stock: stocks with preferred payments but no voting right at current value
* Common stock: stocks with voting rights at current value
* Additional paid in capital: initial value of stocks at issuance minus current
* Retained earnings: earnings kept in the business, can be negative if many losses or paying to much dividend
* Treasury common stock: bought back stock appears here with a minus sign
* Other equity: catchall category

The Share Holder Equity is the sum of the above.

## Checklist for the balance sheet

- [ ] Cash: the cash richest competitor survives in bust times, a relevant metric is cash per market share
- [ ] Cash & Short Term liabilities: cash should ideally exceed short term liabilities, if not, we need strong earnings
- [ ] Inventory: Fluctuating inventory over the years indicates highly competitive industries with bust and booms. Boom and bust cycles vary by industry, but seven years is a good range.
- [ ] Total Receivable, Net: Check among industry, the weakest competitor must provide the longest terms
- [ ] Property, Plant, Equipment: companies without a moat have to reinvest in machines to stay competitive before it wears out.
- [ ] Goodwill & Long term investment: if there is a lot of it, check acquisition history and whether the company knows how to acquire for a good value
- [ ] Total assets & earnings: if there is lot of total assets in comparison to earnings, we have a high barrier of entry. Otherwise new entrants can enter easily.
- [ ] Short term debt: Should be in good ration to long term debt
- [ ] Long term debt due & long term debt due: good companies don't require much debt, should be payable within four years by earning power.
- [ ] Minority interest: This might indicate other parties owning parts of the balance sheet. Analyse where this is coming from if it is significant percentage > 3%.
- [ ] Shareholder equity, Total Liabilities, Treasury common stock: Add the treasury common stock to the shareholder equity instead of subtracting it, then it should be larger total liabilities, i.e. total liabilities divided by that sum should be less than 0.8 except for financial business and other borrowers, where it should lie below the competition.
- [ ] Shareholder equity, earnings, Treasury common stock: Add the treasury common stock to the shareholder equity instead of subtracting it. The earnings per that sum should be high, indicating how good the money uses the investment.
- [ ] Preferred stock: it is a bad sign, because those will get most of the earnings
- [ ] Retained earnings: indicates years of losses or overpaying in dividends, growing is good but not necessary.
- [ ] Treasury common stock: A negative number indicates buyback of stock, a very positive sign.
