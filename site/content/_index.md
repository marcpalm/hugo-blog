    We believe in freedom. Financial freedom is one of the main pillar. Only
    passive income will achieve this. Stock investments are the easiest way to
    start it. You can begin with little sum and it scales indefinitely.

    We distinguish between investing and speculating. Investing means buying
    assets such as stock, real estate and bonds for the earnings they generate.
    Speculating equals buying something to sell it to a greater fool tomorrow.
    We specialise largely on stock investments and analyse them according to
    their financial statement.

      We provide a screener which can be exported to Excel and Google Sheets.
      Although most of the universe can only be seen, if you subscribe to a paid
      plan, some of the content is free.

      We generate reports which do a in depth analysis of the examples. Some of
      them are free, other have to be bought or you need a subscription.

    We want to enable people to become investors. The mental freedom experienced
    by a decent net worth and the knowledge of financial independence greatly
    increase the quality of live. This is what we want our readers to
    experience. By the way, it is totally okay for us that you might decide to
    invest in ETFs after being overwhelmed what goes in the analysis of a single
    stock.
